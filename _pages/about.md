Hi! I am Zhuowei (Jack) Li, currently a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Dimitris N. Metaxas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a7VNhCIAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this, I earned my Master’s degree from [Columbia University](https://www.bme.columbia.edu/biomedical-engineering-homepage), where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Professors [Andrew Laine](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_DmtZtkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Shih-Fu Chang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OMVTRscAAAAJ&hl=en). I also spent two years as a Computer Vision Researcher at SenseTime, working with Professor [Shaoting Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oiBMWK4AAAAJ&hl=en). My Bachelor's degree was completed at Northeastern University, China.

My broad research interests span `Machine Learning`, `Computer Vision`, and `Medical Image Analysis`. Of late, my research focuses on `inference‑time intervention` of `Large Language Models (LLMs)` and `Multi‑modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)` to enhance their `efficiency
and reliability`, as well as leveraging `Reinforcement Learning` to strengthen their `reasoning` capabilities.
